### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a French Junior web developer, bilingual in English and speaking Spanish. 
I recently got a diploma in web development with OpenClassRooms.  

 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking for a job in development to improve my skills and also to share my knowledge.  

We will find on Github the code of the different projects I made.
