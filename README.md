### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a French Junior web developer, bilingual in English and speaking Spanish. 
I recently got a diploma in web development with OpenClassRooms. Then I followed courses with ENI, to learn C# with the .Net framework. I have learned to build applications with Entity framework and SQL server following the MVC pattern. I also made applications with Angular and build the API with .Net for the CRUD actions.

 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking for a job in development to improve my skills and also to share my knowledge.  

We will find on Github the code of the different projects I made.
